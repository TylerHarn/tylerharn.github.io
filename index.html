            <p class="paragraph1">Throughout my high school, my academic journey was shaped by my experiences at <strong>W.A Porter</strong> (2017-2021). This institution offered a diverse set of programs in both the fields of sciences, technology, and business. As I got to my senior years and began to branch out and explore all these programs, I found that both the fields of business and technology interested me. <br><br>This realization drew me towards the <strong>Business Technology Program at Toronto Metropolitan University</strong> (2021-Present), which seemed to be the perfect blend of my interests. I am now in my third year of this program and have gained valuable knowledge through technical concepts such as programming, infrastructure, processes management, and business concepts such as accounting, finance, marketing, and systems analysis.</p>

            <p class="paragraph2">I believe that ITM 301 - <i>IT Infrastructure</i>, has been the most useful to my career path. This course provided me with an introduction to computer hardware, software, networking, equipping me with the knowledge to troubleshoot, maintain, and understand related processes for each. At my first Co-op work experience, I regularly used this information to complete my assigned tasks and understand concepts being explained to me.</p>

            <h2 class="subhead3">EXTRACURRICULARS</h2>
                <p class="Extra-Paragraph">Regarding curriculars related to my program, I am currently in the BTM Co-op program and have completed my first work term as an IT Experience Consultant at Tridel. During this role, I spent my time completing IT projects related to user experience, as well as helping out with service desk tasks.
                In my spare time, I enjoy learning about computer networking and studying for new certifications to add to my resume.</p>
